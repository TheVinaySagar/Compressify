One of the main challenges is the need to store the Huffman tree or the frequency table along with the compressed data, which can add overhead, especially for small datasets. Additionally, Huffman coding is most effective when the input data has a skewed frequency distribution, where some characters are much more frequent than others. In cases where the data has a uniform frequency distribution, the compression gains may be minimal. Despite these challenges, Huffman coding remains a fundamental technique in the field of data compression and continues to be a topic of research and development as new applications and challenges arise in the ever-evolving landscape of digital data.
